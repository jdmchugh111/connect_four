1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project? Kick off understanding with pseudo code, identify each piece of functionality, and then code to create methods/logic for each piece.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on? Computer difficulty feature - using the json ranks, we could adjust to have the computer play on hard or easy mode depending on player rank.
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project. Most of the time we used the ping pong method, building on each other's functionalities, but also ping pong method for refactoring. Occassionally, we would get on zoom to share code or explain something we added.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. We mostly communicated through Slack, but also used line-specific comments in prs to point to changes or questions.
